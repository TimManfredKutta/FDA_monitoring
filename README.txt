Rcode in this folder contains the following files:

-README.txt:
this file

-FDA_online_densities.R:
Rscript that contains change point detection procedure and simulations for 
for sparsely observed random densities

-FDA_online_functions.R:
Rscript that contains change point detection procedure and simulations for 
for random, continuous functions


How to use the code?

Each file can be run separately. The final line of the code gives out a 
test decision. In the last lines of the code parameter settings are 
collected.


The following libraries are needed to peform the analyses:

library('expm')
library('MASS')
